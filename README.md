<h1>TIPE</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project has been taken during my 2 years of preparatory class, it is a complete project that has been planned, organized and finished. The goal was to reduce the loss of water in a regular house, by re-using rain water thanks to a outdoor tank, while redistributing it. 
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Arduino</b>
- <b>AppInventor</b>


<h2>Project walk-through</h2>

First, we can take a look at the few diagrams that describe the project well (in french)<br/>

<br />
<br />
In parallel of this, we created the tank in 3D with the required and physically studied dimensions  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Thus, we created a real model with 3D pieces printed by us, and with all our sensors<br/>

<br />
<br />
Once everything connected to the arduino card, with the Mobile App linked to the arduino code (projet TIPE.ino) (thanks to the bluetooth sensor) we get this<br/>

<br />
<br />
And we have the output from all the different sensors in real time and we can choose to open or close the valve  <br/>
